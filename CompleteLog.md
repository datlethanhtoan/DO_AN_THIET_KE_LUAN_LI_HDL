- **Run some examples on lcd oled.**
- **Research about websever, esp32, FPC1020A sensor.**
- **Design Power suplly using rechargeable battery.**



# 2 weeks (25/9/2023 - 8/9/2023)
# Works
- **Try connect FPC1020A sensor to esp32 and run some examples.**
  -  At first we had a little trouble looking for the library of FPC 1020a for a while. There's hardly any documents or data sheets. But then we realized that the fpc1020a was just an upgrade based on the 1020. So the library of FPC 1020 works pretty well for FPC 1020a. So we decided to use this library for this project. Here's a library link: <https://github.com/JohnJJG/ESP32_FPC1020.git>.
- **Design graphic screen on lcd oled for displaying informations.**
- **Buy and test some rechargeable battery.**
- **Continue to learn about websever, how to connect esp32 to websever and how to build websever.**
>**=> The hardware design of this project is not complicated and we had almost everything about hardware we need. Therefore, We'll do the tests on the breadboard and when the software is complete, it's just a simple pcb to connect all the hardware together.**
  
# Next 2 weeks
- **Implement a simple program with PFC 1020a: have basic functions such as adding, deleting and identifying fingerprints, Change these functions through the buttons. Information is displayed on the oled screen. Test all on breadboard.**
- **Continue to learn about websever and design main interface for websever.**
- **Learn the protocols to transfer data from hardware to the web. Then choose one that matches this project.**
> **_NOTE:_** Because we're about to have a mid-term test, the progress of this project may slow down a bit.
# 2 weeks (30/10/2023 - 13/11/2023)
# Works
 - **Link MCU with sever.**
   - http request must be sent after fixed time and process the respone from sever.
       - **Problem** The execution flow of the program below the mcu must change to handle the above problem => try use timer or some thing like that.
 - **Hardware problem**
   - the fingerprint only be identified in the direction in which it is enroll. => that was a big problem or not ?
# 2 final weeks (30/10/2023 - 13/11/2023)
 # Result
 - **Link demo video :....**
